# Homework-is-on-the-Horiseon

    Horiseon is an online managment company that helps business's streamline the process of marketing their company on the web.
    They put the tools of the internet to work for you, your company and your clients. The current web application that we have here helps to solve some of the clutter and chaos of searching on the web for what solution will work for you. Here we have the areas of interest broken down into 3 categories: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Managment and Social Media Marketing. When each 
    of the links are clicked they fast forward you directly to that tool to help define a little bit more on how they work.
    This helps people narrow down the exact topic that they are looking to solve without wasting countless hours scouring the web.
    The frame works that were used here were simple and modest by only combining CSS and HTML.
